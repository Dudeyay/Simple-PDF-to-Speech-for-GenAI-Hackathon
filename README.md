# Simple-PDF-to-Speech-for-GenAI-Hackathon
A simple python program that converts text content on a PDF to a speech output.
Program first uses PDF2Image library to divide a PDF into .jpg's (one page per image). Uses page-dewarp by running page-dewarp command on Terminal to dewarp warped images. Uses EasyOCR to read each of the image and store the obtained text in a string and finally uses Google Text to Speech (gTTS) to convert string into audio file. Since gTTS can process text in only one language at once, given PDFs with multiple languages, a language detector is implemented to divide the entire text into chunks based on languages, and feeds gTTS chunk by chunk. It is then written on one single audio file to give one output.
